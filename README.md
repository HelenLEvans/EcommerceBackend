# E-commerce Back End: Object-Relational Mapping Challenge

# Description

This challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site, taking a working Express.js API and re-configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It uses MySQL2, Sequelize, Express.js, and the dotenv package.

# Installation

Clone this repository. Create a .env file and enter your database name, username, and password. Initialize the database by running MySQL in the command line, followed by the command "SOURCE db/schema.sql;" (don't inclue the quotation marks). Quit MySQL and seed the database by entering "npm run seed" (don't include the quotation marks). Start the program by entering "npm run start" (don't include the quotation marks).

# Usage

Using Insomnia, enter GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE statements to manipulate the database.
